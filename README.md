# Shadow_Pact
Homebrew BG3 Warlock melee subclass focused on dual wielding

Warlocks who have made a pact with a shadowy creature gaining abilities to manipulate darkness to their benefit.

1- 
	Shadow Strike - Infuse your powers into your weapons adding you Charisma modifier as Cold or Necrotic damage to one handed weapons. Two-handed weapons are too large to be infused this way. You may use any one-handed weapon as a spellcasting focus.
	Shadow proficiencies - Shortsword, stealth proficiency.
	Unarmored Defense - While wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your dexterity modifier + your charisma modifier.
	Shadow Shroud - On your turn, you can don a wraith shroud concealing you from your enemies and gaining resistance to Cold and Necrotic damage and to Physical damage from non-magical attacks for 1 minute and increases your movement by 10 feet, but gain vulnerability to radiant damage. This feature can be used once and recovers on a short/long rest.

6- 
	Enhanced shadows - Enhances Shadow Strike to add double your Charisma modifier and Shadow Shroud to add 2 AC and a 10 feet aura which reduces the speed of enemies inside by 10 feet.

10- 
	Shadow Feint - When you are hit, you can, as a reaction, turn the hit into a miss. You must decide to use this feature after the hit is confirmed, but before any damage rolls are made. You can use this feature three times per long rest.
	
14-
	Shadow Cast - Once per long rest, a shadow duplicate of you can cast a spell from your pact magic feature with a cast time of 1 action or less without using an action or bonus action. The cast still consumes the necessary spell slot.
